    In case there is someone assisting the tournament organization (e.g. the draw master) write their email below.
    Otherwise leave it blank.

    An message will be sent to the email below for every player registering to the tournament.

    It is highly recommended to have at least 2 people in charge of the tournament since it can be a lot of work for a
    single person. Specially on the day of the tournament.
